# bash
Run multiple commands in Minecraft from file.
This is a lightweight plugin that currently supports 1.20.4. I will most likely add availability to all versions. This is a very primitive plugin as of right now, as it is being used to serve one simple purpose on my personal server. I will update this to add more functionality in the future.

Bash will automatically create a folder to place text files in. (execute/)
## Syntax
`/bash <filename> <delay>`
This will run commands in a text file with a delay in ticks. Each line in your .txt file represents one command being sent.

`<filename>` - Name of your file in the folder. Only use the name of the file and not the extension `.txt`

`<delay>` - Delay between each command in ticks.
